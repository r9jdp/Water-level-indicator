This is an intelligent water level monitoring system designed to keep you informed about your tank’s water level. It combines hardware components, software, and web technologies to provide real-time updates. Here’s how it works:

Hardware Components:
Arduino with Ultrasonic Sensor: The heart of the system, the Arduino measures the water level using an ultrasonic sensor.
LED Display: An LED display visually indicates the water level in percentage.
Buzzer: The buzzer alerts you audibly when the water level reaches critical points.
Software Stack:
Front End (React): A user-friendly web interface built in React allows you to monitor the water level remotely.
Back End (Python): The Python back end handles data processing, communicates with the Arduino via websockets, and manages notifications.
Websockets: Real-time communication between the front end and back end ensures instant updates.
Functionality:
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the water level in the tank.
The Arduino sends this data to the Python backend via .
The backend processes the data, determines the water level status, and triggers Application.
Data is sent to your phone, keeping you informed about the tank’s water level.
The LED display and buzzer provide local alerts for immediate attention.
Key Features:

Real-time water level monitoring.
Customizable notifications based on water level thresholds.
Remote access via the web interface.
Easy installation and integration with existing tanks.
Benefits:

Prevents water overflow or depletion.
Saves time and effort by eliminating manual checks.
Enables proactive maintenance and efficient water management.
